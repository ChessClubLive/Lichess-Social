# Lichess-Social
A social network widget for Lichess players
Lichess UI is based on tabs <play> <learn> <watch> <community> <tools> this is the missing bit <social>
<community> consists of <players> <rating stats> <teams> <forum> <questions & answers>
<forum> is in classic format for posts and replies with no chat or live interaction
<lichess-social> is full operational social network, complete with chat, timeline, trending topics, news feed, groups, events, blogging and plenty more
It was designed specifically for lichess players with lichess tv incorporated into the <lichess-social> UI
This is hosted externally and you embed the site on your lichess platform.
The developers of the chess social network are the guys at Chess Club Live who have an established brand in the area of Chess Social
"Chess is a conversation" as their motto goes, well now you have it for lichess players
Enjoy :)
